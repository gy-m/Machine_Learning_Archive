## Overview
* The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate speech recognition base on:
    * Audio File
    * Microphone 
* It consists of the following parts:
    * Part 1 - AudioFile.py and AudioFileNoise.py:  Demonstrated a given audio file which is transcripted into text. There are 2 audio files for part 1. One which is without any ambient noise and another with noise. These two python scripts related to those files and demonstrate how to make a speech recognition based on the files with and without noise.
    * Part 2 - MicrophoneNoise: Demonstrated how one can use it's microphone in an noisy environment and get the transcription of his live recorder voise.
* In this repository I rely on "speech_recognition" module and assign the "recognize_google()" Recognizer. It's worth mentioning there are additional recognizer, as described bellow, but the reason I use google's is beacuse it has hard coded API key which make it much easier to use without the need establishing an authentication service. As said above, additional recognizers are:
    * recognize_bing(): Microsoft Bing Speech
    * recognize_google(): Google Web Speech API
    * recognize_google_cloud(): Google Cloud Speech - requires installation of the google-cloud-speech package
    * recognize_houndify(): Houndify by SoundHound
    * recognize_ibm(): IBM Speech to Text
    * recognize_sphinx(): CMU Sphinx - requires installing PocketSphinx
    * recognize_wit(): Wit.ai
