## Overview
Machine Learning repository conatins projects for variaty of purposes as a part of machine learning study. 
Every project has a seperate directory with seperate readme file.

## Installations
Every project has it's own installations requirements for it's packages and libraries. Nevertheless, most of them need the following installations.
* Miniconda - Installation from the official [Miniconda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). For further information please refer to Real Python's tutorial named [python-windows-machine-learning-setup](https://realpython.com/python-windows-machine-learning-setup/)

## Usage
Setting up the enviroments (best practice):
* Open Visual code (Optional. Can be donw with most of the terminals)
* In the terminal of VC activate conda using the shortcut in the start menu for powershell (For example: `"C:\Users\gymak\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Anaconda3 (64-bit)\Anaconda Powershell Prompt (miniconda3)"`)
* Create your virtual env with python version specification and activate it (`conda create --name my_env python=2.7`)
* Activate the virtual env (`conda activate my_env`)
* After activation install the relevant packages (`conda install -c <chanel name> <package name>`)
* In the terminal of VC open Bash for using GIT

## Notes

## TODO
